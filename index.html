<h1>€ddie$</h1>
<h3>Doublespending</h3>
<b>The punishment for doublespending is asset control lost and cost for doublespending. <b>

<h3>Costs</h3>
<b>You must pay all the affected €$ 10K plus 25% interest before you relinquish your asset control and €$ 10K plus 25% interest when it's changed back. <b>

<h3>Time</h3>
<b>If you doublespend from your 1M €ddie$, your punishment last for 1M minutes. If you created 2M €ddie$ and spend on each privatekey, your punishment last for 2M minutes etc.<b>

<h3>Asset Control</h3>
<b>You must change the manager, reserve, freeze and clawback of your assets to four public addresses randomly chosen by all the affected, this last for which doublespend applies to you. Community members can freeze or destroy €ddie$ in your wallet if they choose too. If community members who control your €ddie$ past away without leaving the privatekey to someone, your €ddie$ control will be lost forever.<b>

<h3>Fortnight</h3>
<b>If you don't reimburse the affected within a fortnight, you loose €ddie$ by the minute. After the fortnight, you must pay 1 €ddie$ per minute per person plus 25% interest. <b>

<h3>Pay per minute</h3>
<b>If you don't pay everyone within the fortnight, you pay 1 €ddie$ per minute per person plus 25% interest that you owe €ddie$. If you refuse to take the steps above, the affected can opt-out of your €ddie$, which will make it unusable.<b>
